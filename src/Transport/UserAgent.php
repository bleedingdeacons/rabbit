 * user-agent that names the application, its version, a human to
 * contact, and the deployment the traffic is coming from:
 *
 *     Rabbit/1.2.3 (rest@aa-bristol.org; https://aa-bristol.org)
 *
 * The environment is this site's own home URL rather than a "test" /
 * "production" label, which makes the two deployments distinguishable
 * upstream without anyone having to maintain a label by hand.
 *
 * Rabbit owns this builder rather than each driver reimplementing
 * it, so the driver plugin (WhatsApp) identifies itself with
 * `UserAgent::forApp('WhatsApp', WHATSAPP_VERSION)` and gets the same
 * shape for free.
