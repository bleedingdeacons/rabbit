/**
 * Thrown by {@see HttpTransport} implementations on network-layer
 * failures — timeouts, DNS errors, TLS handshake errors, connection
 * refused. HTTP status codes (including 4xx and 5xx) are NOT raised
 * as TransportException; they come back as a normal response and the
 * driver decides whether to wrap them in a {@see \Rabbit\Messaging\Interfaces\MessagingException}.
 *
 * This separation matters because the two failure modes mean
 * different things to the operator:
 *  - TransportException → "we couldn't talk to the provider at all"
 *  - 401/403 response   → "we talked to it but it rejected us"
